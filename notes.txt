what is a promise?
A promise is a javascript object that links producing code and consuming code.
it is an object which holds the the result of async operations.

syntax: var variablename = new Promise(()=>{});

new is an inbuilt keyword , in OOP like javascript
inside the promise, it is always takes function as a parameter,
inside the function , we have 2 important parameters=> resolve ,reject 

promise states:
1.pending
2.fulfilled
3.rejected 

resolve and reject are not occur at the same time.
when the result is got rejected it will always shown an error msg along with the result.

when we dont want to get the error msg along the rejected state we have to handle the functions.
.then => success=> resolved
.catch => failure=> rejected

.then and .catch scan be behaved a s an error handling functions

promise with settimeout function

whenever we are using promises, without error handling msgs , settimeout will not work inside it.

Dependant operations:
result got from one function is an input of the next the function.
this is process occurs again and again => promise chaining

if we are using multiple promises , there are more number of .then and .ctach needed
which is a time consuming process and chances of syntax error is high.

to overcome this drawback , we got promise.all method.
it will return all the functions result at the same time eventhough we are using settimeout.

promise.all will always returns a rejected value eventhough some functions 
are getting fullfilled.=> major drawback(it hides all the resolved state,displayed only 
rejected output)

promiseallsettled=> it will shows all the outputs , no matter it got fulfilled or rejected.

it will dispayed the value of which has lowest settimout.

it shows the status of all the functions.
